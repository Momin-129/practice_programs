        First appearing in print in 1887's A Study in Scarlet, the character's
        popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in
        The Strand Magazine, beginning with "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891;
        additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling
        four novels and 56 short stories. All but one[a] are set in the
        Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are
        narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. John H.
        Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and
        often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street,
        London, where many of the stories begin. Though not the first fictional
        detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known.

          [1] By the 1990s, there were already over 25,000 stage adaptations,
          films, television productions and publications featuring the
          detective,[2] and Guinness World Records lists him as the most
          portrayed human literary character in film and television history.[3]
          Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to
          be not a fictional character but a real individual;[4][5][6] numerous
          literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretence. Avid
          readers of the Holmes stories helped create the modern practice of
          fandom.[7] The character and stories have had a profound and lasting
          effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the
          original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than
          Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television,
          films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.
